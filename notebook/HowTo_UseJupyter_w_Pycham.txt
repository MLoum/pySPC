Jupyter ask for a token.

Windows :
1. Laucnh the calculation of a cell. Pycharm ask for a token

2. open a line command (cmd) and type jupyter notebook list

3. copy past the token in the pycyharm's prompt

Running jupyter notebook list will display all of the running servers on your machine. So doing this in the terminal after starting a cell in PyCharm will result in output similar to
Currently running servers:
http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=f85145dda03dc598bbbfa6e53b93cbcb27629ea00cfd2105 :: /home/....
which contains the appropriate token for authenticating.
